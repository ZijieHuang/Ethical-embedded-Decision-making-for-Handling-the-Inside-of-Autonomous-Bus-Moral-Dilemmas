# Ethical-embedded-Decision-making-for-Handling-the-Inside-of-Autonomous-Bus-Moral-Dilemmas

Sorry currently the project is still under development.

The files implement in Python3.

Qucik review each Python file:
- Environment.py has the logic of the autonomous bus ethical dilemmas environment.
- ItemAndAgent.py has the logic of the agents (autonomous bus).
- ValuesNorms.py saves the ethical knowledge followed by ethical principles.
- Learning.py implements the thresholded lexicographic deep q-learning algorithm.
